# Button Guidelines
Buttons are used for entry points (a.k.a. Portals) into various parts of the novel universe. The "Terra Damnata Alpha Portal" (TDAP) will be accessible for holders of the PBTD token. For TDAP access, click the Griffin button.  

## How's that work?
Anyone logged into their Meta Mask wallet AND who owns a PBTD token will be able to signin to TDAP where they'll have access to their advanced copy of *Terra Damnata*. Clicking the Griffin button will trigger a Meta Mask sign in.
