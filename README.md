# Zeemz Announcement

*Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret* upcoming game release and announcement repository.

*Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret* game engine (aka "ZeemzCore") is written in Solidity for Ethereum smart contracts and utilizes the LoomSDK for side-chain transactions. 

Huh?

Zeemz is a multi-blockchain digital trading card game. We're using Ethereum for P2P transactions, ownership records, and other TBD functions that rightly ought to run on the Ethereum mainnet as they're less frequent (more permanent) transactions. For constantly changing (uber dynamic) transactions (equipping/unequipping, potions, in-battle actions, in-game items) we'll utilize LoomSDK.    

*Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret* is based-off the short story, "[Poseidon Knows](https://github.com/pushingbhutons/zeemz-ann/blob/master/Poseidon%20Knows.doc)," written by Monique Finley. The short story takes place a few hundered years before the time of the novel, *[Terra Damnata: Book 1 of the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons series](https://book1.pushingbhutons.com/p/chapters.html).* 


## Uh... What's that? a novel?

*[Terra Damnata: Book 1 of the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons series](https://book1.pushingbhutons.com/p/chapters.html).* is part of a 5 book blog-serial published at the website: www.pushingbhutons.com. The book's presale will be supported by PBTD token, a blockchain asset redeemable by the hodler or sellable by the trader. For more information about the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons: Terra Damnata presale token, please go to: [INSERT REPO FOR PBTD TOKEN - COMING SOON].


## Zeemz are so freakin' cool! I wanna help!!

*Zeemz* is definitely cool! And, we love help. We're building a badass website for Zeemz and it'll contain a page with information for volunteers. We've figured out a few areas that'll need "VoluntZeemz." But, we don't want something for nothing. VoluntZeemz will be able to earn PBTD for their contributions. Volunteers gain access to a side game where every contribution builds their ZeemzSKLZ, gains them ZeemzEXP, finds them ZeemzFOOD, and even shares secrets, erhem, ZeemzKB. Did I mention that these special volunteers will be able to use their VoluntZeemz in the finished Zeemz game? Yep, VoluntZeemz get a free Zeemz as Thank You for their efforts.
