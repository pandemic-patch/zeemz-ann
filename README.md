# Zeemz Announcement

*Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret* upcoming game release and announcement repository.

*Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret* game engine (aka "ZeemzCore") is written in Solidity for Ethereum smart contracts and utilizes the LoomSDK for side-chain transactions. 

### Huh?

Zeemz is a multi-blockchain digital trading card game. We're using Ethereum for P2P transactions, ownership records, and other TBD functions that rightly ought to run on the Ethereum mainnet as they're less frequent (more permanent) transactions. For constantly changing (uber dynamic) transactions (equipping/unequipping, potions, in-battle actions, in-game items) we'll utilize LoomSDK.    

*Zeemz: The Versipisces Secret* is based-off the short story, "[Poseidon Knows](https://github.com/pushingbhutons/zeemz-ann/blob/master/Poseidon%20Knows.doc)," written by Monique Finley. The short story takes place a few hundered years before the time of the novel, *[Terra Damnata: Book 1 of the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons series](https://book1.pushingbhutons.com/p/chapters.html).* 


## Uh... What's that? a novel?

*[Terra Damnata: Book 1 of the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons series](https://book1.pushingbhutons.com/p/chapters.html).* is part of a 5 book blog-serial published at the website: www.pushingbhutons.com. The book's presale will be supported by PBTD token, a utility token with entitlement rights such as being redeemable by the reader, staked by the hodler, or exchangeable by the user.  

The PBTD token is a transferable book presale reciept entitling the holder to one digital copy of *[Terra Damnata: Book 1 of the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons series](https://book1.pushingbhutons.com/p/chapters.html).*

### Wait. A "Presale Token"? 
The PBTD token is a novel key that will open the "Terra Damnata Alpha Portal" (TDAP key), where key hodlers can access an advanced copy of *[Terra Damnata: Book 1 of the Pu'Shing Bhu'Tons series](https://book1.pushingbhutons.com/p/chapters.html)*. Transfering your TDAP key also transfers portal access, and thus advanced copy book access. Trading, purchasing, earning, or recieving a new PBTD token will reenable access.

### But, Book 1 is already online...
Yes, you can read the original FREE blog-serial online right now. I'd totally dig it if you did read it. :D

The *Terra Damnata* novel will be a different reading experience from the blog. Think of the difference between "Cut for TV with Commercials and a 2 hour time slot" and "full Director's Extended Edition with Never Before Seen footage." ;)

## Zeemz are so freakin' cool! I wanna help!!

*Zeemz* is definitely cool! And, we love help. We're building a badass website for Zeemz and it'll contain a page with information for volunteers. We've figured out a few areas that'll need "VoluntZeemz." But, we don't want something for nothing. VoluntZeemz will be able to earn PBTD points for their contribution, these points will be redeemable for PBTD tokens. Volunteers also gain access to a side game where every contribution builds their ZeemzSKLZ, gains them ZeemzEXP, finds them ZeemzFOOD, and even shares secrets, erhem, ZeemzKB. Did I mention that these special volunteers will be able to use their VoluntZeemz in the finished Zeemz game? Yep, VoluntZeemz get a free Zeemz as Thank You for their efforts.

### VoluntZeemz : ZeemzSKLZ : Description
